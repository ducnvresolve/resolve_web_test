**Containers**

Google Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment. In this way, containers virtualize the operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public cloud or even on a developer’s personal laptop. From Gmail to YouTube to Search, everything at Google runs in containers. Containerization allows our development teams to move fast, deploy software efficiently, and operate at an unprecedented scale.

**API Management (Apigee)**

Apigee is Google Cloud’s API management platform for developing and managing APIs. By fronting services with a proxy layer, Edge provides an abstraction or facade for your backend service APIs and provides security, rate limiting, quotas, analytics, and more.

Companies often expose services as a set of HTTP endpoints. Client app developers then make HTTP requests to these endpoints. Depending on the endpoint, the service might then return data, formatted as XML or JSON, back to the client app.

Because providers make their services available over the web, they must ensure that they have taken all necessary steps to secure and protect their services from unauthorized access. As a service provider, consider:

- Security: How will you control access to your services to prevent unauthorized access?

  - Compatibility: Will your services work across different platforms and devices?

    - Measurability: How can you monitor your services to make sure they are available?

      - Monetization: How can you track and bill customers for access to your services?
        - And many other considerations

      After a client app has been released that accesses any services, the service provider is then required to make sure that those services continue to work over time as they add, modify, or delete those services. The service provider must also have a way to keep app developers aware of any changes to the services to ensure that client apps stay in sync with those services.

      Client app developers face challenges when trying to consume services from different providers. There are many technologies available today for use by a service provider to expose its services. The same client app might have to use one mechanism to consume a service from one provider, and a different mechanism to consume a service from a different provider. App developers can even face the situation where they have to use different mechanisms to consume services from the same provider.

      Apigee enables you to provide secure access to your services with a well-defined API that is consistent across all of your services, regardless of service implementation. A consistent API:

      - Makes it easy for app developers to consume your services.
      - Enables you to change the backend service implementation without affecting the public API.
      - Enables you to take advantage of the analytics, monetization, developer portal, and other features built into Apigee.
      - The following image shows an architecture with Apigee handling the requests from client apps to your backend services:

      Rather than having app developers consume your services directly, they access an API proxy created on Apigee. The API proxy functions as a mapping of a publicly available HTTP endpoint to your backend service. By creating an API proxy you let Apigee handle the security and authorization tasks required to protect your services, as well as to analyze, monitor, and monetize those services.

      Because app developers make HTTP requests to an API proxy, rather than directly to your services, developers do not need to know anything about the implementation of your services. All the developer needs to know is:

          * The URL of the API proxy endpoint.
            * Any query parameters, headers, or body parameters passed in a request.
              * Any required authentication and authorization credentials.
                * The format of the response, including the response data format, such as XML or JSON.

      The API proxy isolates the app developer from your backend service. Therefore you are free to change the service implementation as long as the public API remains consistent. By maintaining a consistent frontend API, existing client apps will continue to work regardless of changes on the backend.

      You can use policies on the API proxy to add functionality to a service without having to make any changes to the backend service. For example, you can add policies to your proxy to perform data transformations and filtering, add security, execute conditional logic or custom code, and to perform many other actions. The important thing to remember is you implement policies on Apigee, not on your backend server.

      **Storage**

      Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is an object storage service offered by Google Cloud, used to store and manage unstructured data. It provides a reliable, scalable, and secure way to store any amount of data, regardless of its type or format. 

      GCS offers different storage classes to optimize for cost and access frequency:
